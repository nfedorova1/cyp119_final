# Planning for Sustainability Final Project

This repository contains part of the group project assignment for CYPLAN 119, where each group was tasked with a holistic evaluation of a given city's sustainability performance by sector. This included cross-referencing planning documents with progress reports, and ultimately the usage of appropriate sustainability metrics to measure the improvements in an area's effort to be more equitable and environmentally-conscious, while also expanding its economy.

I evaluated the city of New Orleans, Louisiana in its sustainability measures regarding its transportation sector.
